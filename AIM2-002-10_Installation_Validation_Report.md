## Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues (Priority 1 - Immediate Action Required)

#### Issue 1: Invalid Dependency Specification
- **File:** `requirements-dev.txt` line 116
- **Problem:** `pdb++>=0.10.3` - Invalid package name format
- **Impact:** Prevents entire package installation
- **Error Details:**
  ```
  Expected end or semicolon (after name and no valid version specifier)
  pdb++>=0.10.3
     ^
  ```
- **Recommended Fix:**
  ```diff
  - pdb++>=0.10.3                    # Enhanced Python debugger
  + pdbpp>=0.10.3                    # Enhanced Python debugger
  ```
- **Alternative:** Use `ipdb>=0.13.0` which is more standard

#### Issue 2: Package Metadata Generation Failure
- **Problem:** setuptools cannot parse setup.py due to dependency issues
- **Impact:** Package cannot be installed in development mode
- **Root Cause:** Invalid dependency in extras_require section
- **Recommended Fix:** Fix dependency specification and re-test

#### Issue 3: Missing Core Dependencies
- **Problem:** numpy, pandas, yaml, click not installed
- **Impact:** Core functionality unavailable
- **Root Cause:** Installation failure prevents dependency resolution
- **Recommended Fix:** Resolve dependency specification issues

### High Priority Issues (Priority 2 - Address Soon)

#### Issue 4: CLI Entry Points Not Available
- **Problem:** `aim2-extract`, `aim2-ontology`, `aim2-benchmark` commands not found
- **Impact:** User workflow severely impacted
- **Root Cause:** Package installation failure
- **Recommended Fix:** Verify entry_points configuration in setup.py after fixing installation

#### Issue 5: Pre-commit Hooks Installation Failure
- **Problem:** Silent failure during hooks installation
- **Impact:** Development workflow incomplete
- **Recommended Fix:** Investigate pre-commit configuration and add better error handling

### Medium Priority Issues (Priority 3 - Monitor and Improve)

#### Issue 6: Limited Cross-platform Testing
- **Problem:** Only tested on macOS
- **Impact:** Windows/Linux compatibility uncertain
- **Recommended Fix:** Set up CI/CD with multiple platforms

#### Issue 7: Test Coverage Gaps
- **Problem:** Some edge cases not covered
- **Impact:** Potential hidden issues
- **Recommended Fix:** Expand test scenarios for network failures, permission issues
