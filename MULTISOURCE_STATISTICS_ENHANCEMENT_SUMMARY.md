# Multi-Source Statistics Enhancement Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive enhancements made to the OntologyManager's statistics functionality to support multi-source ontology loading scenarios. The enhancements provide detailed insights into source-specific performance, overlap analysis, and comprehensive aggregation metrics.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **Enhanced Statistics Collection**

#### Original Statistics
- Basic load counts (total, successful, failed)
- Cache statistics (hits, misses, size)
- Simple format tracking
- Aggregate ontology counts (terms, relationships)

#### New Multi-Source Statistics
- **Source-specific tracking**: Individual statistics for each loaded source
- **Performance metrics**: Timing analysis across all operations
- **Overlap analysis**: Term and relationship overlap between ontologies
- **Coverage analysis**: Per-source content breakdown
- **Format distribution**: Sources grouped by format type

### 2. **New Statistics Categories**

#### Multi-Source Specific Statistics
```python
{
    "sources_loaded": 3,                    # Successfully loaded sources
    "sources_attempted": 3,                 # Total sources attempted
    "source_success_rate": 1.0,             # Success rate (0.0-1.0)
    "sources_by_format": {                  # Sources grouped by format
        "owl": ["/path/to/file1.owl"],
        "csv": ["/path/to/file2.csv"],
        "json": ["/path/to/file3.json"]
    },
    "source_coverage": {                    # Per-source content breakdown
        "/path/to/file1.owl": {
            "terms_count": 10,
            "relationships_count": 5,
            "format": "owl",
            "ontology_id": "ONT:001",
            "average_load_time": 0.15
        }
    },
    "overlap_analysis": {                   # Ontology overlap analysis
        "common_terms": ["TERM:001"],       # Terms common to ALL ontologies
        "common_relationships": [],          # Relationships common to ALL
        "unique_terms_per_ontology": {      # Unique terms per ontology
            "ONT:001": ["UNIQUE:001", "UNIQUE:002"]
        },
        "overlap_matrix": {                 # Pairwise Jaccard similarity
            "ONT:001": {"ONT:002": 0.2, "ONT:003": 0.0},
            "ONT:002": {"ONT:001": 0.2, "ONT:003": 0.167}
        }
    }
}
```

#### Performance Statistics
```python
{
    "performance": {
        "total_load_time": 1.25,           # Total time for all loads
        "average_load_time": 0.417,        # Average per successful load
        "fastest_load_time": 0.15,         # Fastest individual load
        "slowest_load_time": 0.65          # Slowest individual load
    }
}
```

### 3. **Source-Specific Statistics Tracking**

Each source now maintains detailed statistics:

```python
{
    "load_attempts": 2,                    # Number of load attempts
    "successful_loads": 1,                 # Successful loads
    "failed_loads": 1,                     # Failed loads
    "total_load_time": 0.45,               # Cumulative load time
    "average_load_time": 0.225,            # Average load time
    "format": "owl",                       # Detected format
    "terms_count": 15,                     # Terms in loaded ontology
    "relationships_count": 8,              # Relationships in loaded ontology
    "last_load_time": 0.25,                # Most recent load time
    "ontology_id": "ONT:001"               # ID of loaded ontology
}
```

### 4. **New Methods Added**

#### `get_ontology_statistics()`
- Comprehensive statistics method with multi-source support
- Delegates to enhanced `get_statistics()` method
- Provides backward compatibility

#### `get_source_statistics(source_path=None)`
- Get statistics for specific source or all sources
- Enables detailed source-level analysis
- Supports filtering by source path

#### Internal Enhancement Methods
- `_update_source_statistics()`: Track per-source metrics
- `_update_performance_statistics()`: Track timing metrics
- `_get_multisource_statistics()`: Generate multi-source insights

### 5. **Overlap Analysis Features**

#### Common Elements Identification
- **Common terms**: Terms present in ALL loaded ontologies
- **Common relationships**: Relationships present in ALL loaded ontologies
- **Unique terms per ontology**: Terms unique to each ontology

#### Similarity Matrix
- **Jaccard similarity**: Measures overlap between each pair of ontologies
- **Formula**: `|A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|` (intersection over union)
- **Range**: 0.0 (no overlap) to 1.0 (identical)

### 6. **Robust Error Handling**

#### Format Statistics Protection
- Automatic conversion of dictionary to defaultdict when needed
- Handles test scenarios that reset statistics improperly
- Maintains compatibility with existing test suites

#### Source Statistics Cleanup
- Automatic cleanup when ontologies are removed
- Consistent state maintenance across operations
- Proper handling of failed load scenarios

## Usage Examples

### Basic Multi-Source Statistics
```python
manager = OntologyManager()
results = manager.load_ontologies([
    "ontology1.owl",
    "ontology2.csv",
    "ontology3.json"
])

stats = manager.get_statistics()
print(f"Loaded {stats['sources_loaded']} of {stats['sources_attempted']} sources")
print(f"Success rate: {stats['source_success_rate']:.2%}")
```

### Source-Specific Analysis
```python
# Get statistics for specific source
source_stats = manager.get_source_statistics("ontology1.owl")
print(f"Average load time: {source_stats['average_load_time']:.3f}s")

# Get all source statistics
all_sources = manager.get_source_statistics()
for source, stats in all_sources.items():
    print(f"{source}: {stats['terms_count']} terms")
```

### Overlap Analysis
```python
stats = manager.get_statistics()
overlap = stats['overlap_analysis']

print(f"Common terms: {overlap['common_terms']}")
print("Ontology similarities:")
for ont1, similarities in overlap['overlap_matrix'].items():
    for ont2, similarity in similarities.items():
        if ont1 != ont2:
            print(f"  {ont1} <-> {ont2}: {similarity:.3f}")
```

## Performance Impact
